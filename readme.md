# MERN Chat Project

I am working on this project to test my learnings on MERN stack (particularly on web-sockets).

- demo --> https://master--lighthearted-gecko-07699b.netlify.app/

### disclaimer : This project is not made for production use. So, I have set some limitations to avoid possible abuses.

- You cannot send more then 50 messages.
- Your account will be automatically deleted after 15 days.
- Both frontend and backend is deployed on free services (netlify and render). So, it may take a bit longer time then usual to get responce.

## Instructions to use.

- Create an account. (Email is mendatory, it will be used for verification)
- Once account is created, Search users to chat with.

Thanks...
